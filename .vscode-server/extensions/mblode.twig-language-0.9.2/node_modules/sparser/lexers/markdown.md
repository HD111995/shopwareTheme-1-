# Lexer - markdown

## Parsing as HTML
The markdown lexer parses into an equivalent HTML structure.  The parsed output can be literally taken as HTML, which is used internally in this applications build process to convert documentation in markdown format to HTML format.  Although the parse output reflects HTML the conversion back to a purely markdown string output is little more than vanity once the language specification is well understood.
